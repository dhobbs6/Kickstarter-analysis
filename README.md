# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project & Purpose
The purpose of the assignment was to determine how different campaigns fared with respect to their launch dates and funding goals. Then, create a visual representation of that data. 
## Analysis and Challenges
When creating the Successful US Kickstarters and Failed US Kickstarters sheets my data would never filter and carry over to a new sheet correctly. So, when I went to gather my data for my Descriptive Analysis section, my data did not match the data provided within the module. I had to get some help in filtering and copying my data over correctly in order to get the correct results in my Descriptive Analysis sheet.  
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1- Looking at our outcomes based on launch dates chart, we can determine that May saw the highest count of successful outcomes. 
2- When determining the best time to launch, based on our chart, May through July saw the highest success count. Deciding to launch during the summer (May-July) would increase the likelihood of success based on our data. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Monetary goals, especially those around $15,000 or less, have a better shot at being successful. It looks like the higher the monetary goal is, the less likely it will be successful. 

## Results
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Technically we do not know, especially after the $15,000 goal range, why as we have a higher monetary goal there is also a less likely chance of it succeeding. We can speculate, but we do not have surveying data indicating reasons as to why. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Looking back at the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date chart, we could change the filter to show all categories and see if the summer (May-July) still saw the highest success count as theater did.
